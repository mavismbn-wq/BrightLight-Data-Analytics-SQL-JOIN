SQL JOIN Practice Instructions
General Guidelines:
1. Use the provided CSV files:
-o orders_large.csv
-o products_large.csv
-o customers_large.csv
2. Import the datasets into a SQL database system of your choice (e.g., MySQL,
PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Snowflake).
3. Use the appropriate JOINs (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER
JOIN) to answer each question.
4. Ensure your query returns exactly the expected columns listed for each
question.
5. Use aliases and format your SQL code for readability.
6. When using FULL OUTER JOIN, make sure your SQL engine supports it (e.g.,
MySQL does not support it natively — use UNION of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN if
needed).
